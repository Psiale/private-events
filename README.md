# Ruby on Rails: Private Events

 Solution to the *Private Events* excercises from The Odin Project's [Associations Section](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations). We added two extra features: one for users to invite another users, and another for users to accept or decline the invitation.
